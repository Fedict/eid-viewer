This is the packaging project for eid-viewer.
The eid-viewer is a Java application
Because it was very inefficient to build the eid-viewer binaries on each intented platform each time,
we decided to build it only once per commit, and create packages from a tarball generated from that.

In short: 

If you ./configure ; make in the directory above, you will actually need a JDK and Maven (2 or 3), and run
in a 32-bit system, because that will actually build the viewer from sources (and the Maven will download many dependencies). 
The artifact of that is a packaging directory containing the viewer jar, a lib dir containing it's dependencies, a .sh
file intented to be symlinked in a GNU/Linux binary directory, and a Win32 .exe that will check for a JRE,
and launch the viewer jar. This does not create packages.

If you want to build eid-viewer packages for one of the distros in here, please place a .tar.gz file
containing the already compiled viewer and dependencies (and created by the build one directory up)
inside this directory, then use the build-<distro> scripts to create packages.
