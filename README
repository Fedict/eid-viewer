BUILD:

Requires a recent Maven installation, with dependencies.
Tested only on GNU/Linux systems, but should work on any Maven-enabled system

for all Platforms Except MS Windows:
------------------------------------

$ mvn clean package

produces:

- a shaded, runnable jar file in eid-viewer-gui/target:
	e.g. eid-viewer-gui/target/eid-viewer-gui-4.0.6.jar
	run with java -jar eid-viewer-gui/target/eid-viewer-gui-4.0.6.jar
	on many platforms, this jar can be ran directly, e.g.
	double-clicked or used as an executable.

- a zipped OSX Application Bundle in eid-viewer-osx/target
	e.g. eid-viewer-osx/target/eid-viewer-osx-4.0.6-bundle.zip
	copy to an OSX system and unzipping will awake its bundle nature:
	It will become a runnable application. Double-click to run.

There are autoconf/automake files in the distribution root dir,
to facilitate packaging/running on GNU/Linux systems. These assume the
presence of the shaded jar described above. See comments in Makefile.am

for MS Windows:
---------------

In addition, if you have a local launch4j installation, add it as a
property: e.g. 

$ mvn -Dlaunch4j-base=/opt/launch4j clean package

.. this produces, additionally to the 2 artifacts described above,

- a 32-bit MS Windows Executable file, in eid-viewer-win32/target
	e.g. eid-viewer-win32/target/eid-viewer-4.0.6.exe
	copy to an MS-Windows system, and double-click.

(We used the launch4j maven plugin, in previous versions, eliminating
the need for a local launch4j installation, but this plugin is unmaintained,
while launch4j itself is alive and kicking. The resulting .exe was no longer
fully functional. This compromise is slightly more difficult to build,
but much better for the end-user).
